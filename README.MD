## Hi, I'm genaray 💻
I am a 23-year-old computer science student and technology enthusiast living in NRW, Germany.

I recently finished my bachelor thesis at a small local IT company, and I am looking forward to doing my master as well.

I mostly use C# and Java on a daily basis. However, I love learning new languages and technologies. 
In my spare time, I mostly play with Unity and develop small games.
