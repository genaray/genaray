## Hi, I'm genaray 💻
I am a 24-year-old Developer, indie gamedev and technology enthusiast living in NRW, Germany.

I recently finished my bachelor thesis in the field of computer science and has been working in a small but excellent local company ever since as a Full-Stack Developer. 

I mostly use C# and Java on a daily basis. However, I love learning new languages and technologies. 
In my spare time, I mostly play with Unity and develop small games.
